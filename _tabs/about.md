# About 

Over the past six years, I have journeyed from engineering to the exciting world of data science, constantly seeking new challenges and growth. Along the way, I explored diverse endeavorsâ€”particularly in direct sales, where I honed my communication and negotiation skills by promoting products I truly believed in. My passion for mathematics, physics, and chemistry led me to take on the role of educator, helping others grasp complex concepts and guiding them to greater confidence and proficiency. This experience of empowering others through shared knowledge has been deeply rewarding.

These varied experiences, spanning six years, have enriched my professional path and reinforced my belief in the transformative power of learning and collaboration. Now, as I continue my journey in data science, I am focused on integrating my passions and skills to contribute meaningfully to the community and beyond.
